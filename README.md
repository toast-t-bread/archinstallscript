# archinstallscript
Script for post-install setup

# WARNING
#### I do not personally use arch linux anymore or regularly install it, so there way be large problems with the script 
### _USE WITH CAUTION_

This script will install a bunch of quality-of-life packages for arch beginners.
Note: this script will probably not be updated so only use this within a few months of the last commit or ask me to update if you want

To install:

First open a terminal if you're in a graphical session, and install git with whichever works

``sudo pacman -S git``
``doas pacman -S git``
``su -c 'pacman -S git'``

```
git clone https://github.com/toast-t-bread/archinstallscript.git
cd archinstallscript
./script.sh
```
