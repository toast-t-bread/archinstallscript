# archinstallscript
Script for post-install setup

# WARNING
#### I do not personally use arch linux anymore or regularly install it, so there way be large problems with the script 
### _USE WITH CAUTION_

This script will install a bunch of quality-of-life packages for arch beginners.
Note: this script will probably not be updated so only use this within a few months of the last commit or ask me to update if you want

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/toast-t-bread/archinstallscript.git
cd archinstallscript
```

if you have sudo installed (most people):
``sudo chmod +x script.sh``

if you have doas installed (pretty rare and not mutually exclusive)
``doas chmod +x script.sh``

and finally:

``./script.sh``

The script will automatically self-destruct unless you cancel it at the end so if you want to keep it arund for whatever reason, keep an eye on it!
